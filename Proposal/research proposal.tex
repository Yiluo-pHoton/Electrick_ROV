\section{Introduction}
Often times there exist terrain on which people cannot tread on. Imagine the complex structure of the debris after an earthquake or hurricane, where an external force of a human stepping on it might cause additional collapse of the structure, putting victims under it in further danger. However, we would like to conduct massive search for survivors under the debris. General search could be done by some high-end device far away, and close up confirmation for each potential signal of life could be carried out by smaller sized vehicles such as drones and ground robots. While drones have high mobility around, the ground robot can go under small holes closer to the survivors. By carrying necessary communication tools and sensors, we could get specific conditions of the survivors, which would be immensely helpful in forming the rescue plan accordingly.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\\\indent However, even when a signal of life has been detected, there are still obstacles. Removing the top layers of debris might do damage to the lower layer. Depending on the actual situation of the victim and the structure above the victim, a mature rescue plan might take hours in finalizing. Time is an important factor in this process. To earn more time and make sure the victim can stay with us, a ground robot that have access to the victim could then provide necessary care such as food, water, conversation, and hope to stabilize the conditions of the victim.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\\\indent In this project, we propose to control the robot with a visualized terrain, that serves like a sandbox in military planning. This visualized terrain will provide visual aid to help anyone just arriving grasp the overall picture and the current progress of the rescue plan. Viewer should be able to identify all the potential, confirmed, and successfully saved signals of life as well as the location of the robots and their past and queued trajectories and missions.
